# Brave Random World

Text-based dystopia generator.

A new dystopia is generated for each of your game.<br/>
The world status offers different problematics and solutions.

You see all these people eating all they want and partying all day.<br/>
Do you envy them? Or do you hate them? Or what?<br/>
Whatever, you care.<br/>
You care because, you, you're at the botton of the social ladder.

You got to do something.

## Litterature

Despite the name, it's not a Brave-New-World-like dystopian vision. I just found the name cool.

## Development

If you're interested, you can check the chronicle.txt file. It's the roadmap/reference document.

## Technical Stuff

Made during vacation far away fron home with no good internet access so it's kind of homemade. Homemade. With a high-level language and a game framework but, you know, homemade. Yeah.
